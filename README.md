# Real Time Training
This project investigates the possibilities of small-scale real-time model training and serving. Initially only with a Streamlit front-end, but will later add FastAPI backend.

# Virtual Environment
```python3 -m venv ~/.realtime-training```  
```source ~/.realtime-training/bin/activate```

# Structure
- streamlit-ui.py contains the front-end interactive code to be run with ```streamlit run streamlit-ui.py```. Here, the user can choose between either making an inference with the pretrained model, or fine-tune the model by providing an extra sample, which is appended to the dataset and saved.  
For training, the user can choose to either do hyperparameter optimization or not.
- mylib contains the files for hyperparameter optimization, data cleaning, and model traning.
- app.py and app_test.py will be used later to introduce the FastAPI backend.
- model.ipynb is a play-notebook for rapid testing.
